            <p>The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.

        <p>Venturing out into space gave us the chance not only to look out, but also to look back – back at Earth, the only home we’ve ever known. In the process, we have gained a unique perspective of our place within the universe and also of the fragility and interconnectedness of our planet. Think Global decades of Earth-watching have made the agency an expert on our environment: the water and vast oceans, ice and snow, land air and the planet’s living ecosystems. Today, Think Global Inc. monitors Earth's vital signs from land, air and space with a fleet of satellites and ambitious airborne and ground-based observation campaigns. While it takes a lot of effort to launch satellites into space, they are ideally suited to observing our climate because they orbit the entire planet many times a day. The speed of spacecraft (typically a few miles per second) means that instruments onboard satellites can quickly observe a wide range of conditions. Modern satellite instruments are able to generate billions of data points per day and the global data records they provide enables us to look at the largest scales. In addition, an army of Think Global scientists and researchers work to analyze the data we collect, interpret the results and develop models and computer analysis tools to better see how our planet is changing. They also work to identify the most burning questions about our climate and formulate the next missions and projects that will help answer them. Think Global shares the knowledge it gains with the rest of the world. It works with institutions in Canada and around the world that help understand and protect our home planet, providing them with robust science information that can be used to make informed decisions. This page gives a snapshot of some of the climate scientists working at Think Global and the work that they do. It is by no means a complete catalogue, but rather intended to give a sense of the type of work that is being done and some of the people that do it. </p>
